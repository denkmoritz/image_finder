# Welcome to *Image Finder*

The goal of this project is to identify image pairs that share a similar visual appearance. For example, consider a street crossing. Street-view images are usually captured from a car, so the perspective is from the middle of the road. As a pedestrian, however, your view would be from the sidewalk. Although both perspectives show the same scene, they look quite different.

This project focuses on finding pairs of images that represent the same view and have a similar heading. The aim is to build a dataset of such pairs. This dataset can then be used in studies where people are asked to rank images based on qualities such as beauty or to compare how different perspectives influence perception.

The repository provides tools to simplify the process of creating this dataset. The data used comes from Mapillary.
